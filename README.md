# Introduction

This project is a recreation of the i-want-to-study-engineering.org page for the question 'balances', created as part of the Web Applications Development module for MSc Web Technologies. This project demonstrates Firebase integration in a React app, utilising Google authentication, Firestore, Firebase Storage and Realtime Database to build the page and allow user interaction, additionally using Bootstrap to create a clean visual layout.

The application aims to fulfil the assessment criteria by implementing the following three features:
  1. Live chat support between the user and an admin, including image upload support
  2. The ability for the admin to add a message from chat to an FAQs page
  3. Hints in the forms of percentages shown on each answer, showing how many other users have selected each answer
